CS394 - iOS

Assignment 1 README:
  - BUG: Images from previous round doesn't disappear in new round. The new round images are stacked on top of the old ones.
    FIXED!!!!!!!!!!

  - Everything else works as expected, dealer AI, score, hit, stand, etc.
  - The betting win/loss score is static for now

  - TODO: Ace is viewed as 11 for pip score always, need to add cases for when ace should be one
  - TODO: Need to add case for Blackjack win (21)
  - TODO: DOUBLE AND SPLIT (maybe more complicated :(, especially with viewing the cards) needs to be added, but only if there is time as this might be too much for a simple game.

  - Code is pretty ghetto, still learning iOS: Can be cleaned up a lot if there is time
